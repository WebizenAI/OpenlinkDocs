# OpenlinkDocs (Webizen Project)

Openlink Virtuoso is the leading candidate for providing Semantic Web foundations for Webizen local-host implementations.  Most are not familiar with semantic web development, management, governance and support generally, other than as a consumer of these systems, as is built into most web-sites and systems.

The works of Openlink leadership community, has forged a path and capability that is generally not well known.  The First free version of Virtuoso was released in April 2006[1], the documentation for Virtuoso has been developed over decades, yet, as the primary market for these sorts of products has been enterprise, government, advanced research (STEM) and Infrastructure[2] involving Expert consulting support, the documentation for Virtuoso has not been updated as much as is considered important, for Webizen related implementations.

This project seeks to create documentation for openlink software products that both relate to webizen implementations, and as may be communicated for the intended benefit of webizen and other local-host implementers.  Once this has been achieved, it is hoped that the resources will then be used to train a software agent and provide related tools, to support integrators, ict professionals and end-users.

## Obsidian 

Obsidian is being used to develop the documentation folder.  To download obsidian see: https://obsidian.md/ 

Obsidian Files are (basically) markdown files.  To view, download (fork if desired) the repo and open the relevent folder with obsidian. 

The Obsidian Files are located in the obsidian folder.  This folder will contain Evolutions, with the first being an 0.1.0 objective, that will remain incomplete until version 1.0


## Webizen Project

The Webizen project is developing a new form of computing environment.  The methodology seeks to provide solutions that improve support for human rights and humanitarian ict foundations.

When building a webizen local-host device and platform, there are various commponents that are needed, and then need to be configured in a particular way.  This then acts to provide a developer environment to produce new forms of applications and services.  Openlink Virtuoso, and related offerings, do not provide an entire solution, but they do provide a tried and tested foundation of systems and functionality that is of instrumental importance for these local-host platforms.  There are alternatives, which may be illustrated elsewhere, but with a view to seeking to recommend the use of virtuoso, these docs are being produced and i hope, are found helpful.

### NOTE

This repo has just been initiated.  It will evolve, but will contain errors, etc.  For Official Documentation for Openlink Software, see their website: https://www.openlinksw.com/ and find the links.  This project is being undertaken as an Openlink Virtuoso Advocate and End-User.  Most resources, texts and materials sourced should contain a source-link.

It is expected that the documentation will in-turn develop to illustrate local-host / webizen specific implementation guidenance, integration guides and similar which may be dependent upon openlink virtuoso, but also considereed seperate.  Where it makes sense to do so, updates and packages for Virtuoso will be considered and provided, somewhwere, somehow.! 

Ideas that may relate to Openlink Software Virtuoso, may be initially considered in the obsidian docs, prior to formal evaluation. these notes will be in a seperate 'ideas' folder.
