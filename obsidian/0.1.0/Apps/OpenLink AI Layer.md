Smart Agent Layer that leverages the GPT family of Large Language Models (LLMs) for providing a new generation software application experience that's driven by a natural language-based conversational interface. This solution takes natural language input (text or voice) which is then translated into knowledge base lookups using a variety of declarative query languages such as SQL, SPARQL, SPASQL, and GraphQL.

The **OpenLink AI Layer (OPAL)** breathes new life into the quest for high-performance, secure data access, integration, and management.

OPAL offers a comprehensive solution for advanced data interaction by combining the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Graphs, and RAG, and utilizing declarative query languages such as SPARQL, SQL, and SPASQL (SPARQL inside SQL).
