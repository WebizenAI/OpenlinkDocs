## VAD - Virtuoso Application Distribution

Once you've got your server running, the next thing you'll want to check-out is the VAD Packages.

The system should have some VAD Packages pre-installed, however you'll find others are available via [this section of the Openlink Website](https://shop.openlinksw.com/license_generator/vad/) under 'Virtuoso Add-On Modules'.

VAD provides a package distribution framework for installation, management, dependency checking and un-installation of Virtuoso applications. A VAD package contains all required Virtuoso components, which would constitute an application or hosted solution, within a single distributable file. A VAD package cannot contain any system parts independent of Virtuoso thus excluding operating system executables, shared objects, installers or settings.

Virtuoso and VAD provide the following abilities:

|   |
|---|
|List all installed VAD packages.|
|List all completed operations over VAD packages.|
|Dependency checking - Check preconditions for installation of a package.|
|Install a VAD package.|
|Verification of installed package, compare to distribution state with ability to build of list of locally changed parts of the package.|
|Check preconditions for un-installation of a package.|
|Uninstall a VAD package.|
