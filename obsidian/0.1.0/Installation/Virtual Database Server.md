Virtuoso's Virtual Database Engine enables you to produce Dynamic Web Content from any major database management system. This enables dynamic, real-time HTML and XML generation from any number of different database engines concurrently. The Visual Server Administration Interface of Virtuoso allows you to effortlessly remotely choose and configure remote data sources to be linked into Virtuoso. Once a table is linked into Virtuoso then it is usable like any native table leaving you free to perform join queries without ever worrying about the underlying data source.
