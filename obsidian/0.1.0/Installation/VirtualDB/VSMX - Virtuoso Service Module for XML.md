## 3.8. VSMX - Virtuoso Service Module for XML

Every WSDL file generated by Virtuoso is automatically accompanied by a SOAP Operations Test page known as a VSMX file, which has the extension .vsmx. You find this file in the same place as the WSDL file. For a SOAP enabled virtual directory you have the facility to find the WSDL file:

http://[host:port]/[SOAP Virtual Directory]/services.wsdl

likewise you also get a VSMX file:

http://[host:port]/[SOAP Virtual Directory]/services.vsmx

You simply point your web browser to this file for the test page. The demo database contains samples that can be found as:

http://[host:port]/SOAP/services.vsmx
