This to-do items list is intended to provide an outline of 'things to do', that may both include processes that need to be done to improve the documentation; and may also, include ideas, functionality, tasks and objectives that relate to things that could improve the product.

There are alot of assets that exist, but are difficult to find. An example of 'to do' for these examples is to make notes of resource locations, that then need to be incorporated into documentation.


An example of 'to do' that relates to things not thought to exist, includes the means to improve the user-experience in relation to installations that aim to provide a back-end for RWW like apps.
