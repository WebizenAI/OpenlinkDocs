# OpenLink Unleashes Virtuoso 8.x

## Virtuoso Transforms Digital Business with Fusion of Artificial Intelligence & Multi-Model Relational Database Technology

### Accelerating Digital Transformation through Fusion of Artificial Intelligence and Multi-Model Database Management

Enterprises are looking to increase the degree to which Artificial Intelligence informs Digital Transformation strategy. Digitized cognition is increasingly being applied to the perennial challenge of conceptually integrating and harnessing data that's been spread across DBMS-backed Systems of Record, Engagement, and Intelligence.

Rather than requiring that users "rip and replace" their legacy technology investments, Virtuoso's new Custom Reasoning & Inference module infuses Artificial Intelligence into native and virtualized data that's accessible by existing applications and services using existing open standards such as [HTTP](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), [SPARQL](http://dbpedia.org/resource/SPARQL), [SQL](http://dbpedia.org/resource/SQL), [ODBC](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Open_Database_Connectivity), [JDBC](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Java_Database_Connectivity), and [ADO.NET](http://dbpedia.org/resource/ADO.NET).

### Using Cognitive Attribute-based Access Controls (ABAC) to drive Data Privacy and Security

Data virtualization across disparate systems requires a loosely-coupled conceptualization of identity, identification, authentication, and data access.

Virtuoso 8.x provides a unique and scalable solution, based on a combination of rules and cognition, that addresses contemporary challenges associated with data access control, at massive scales. Rather than reusing outdated Role-based security and coarse-grained User Identity, this latest release of Virtuoso exploits fine-grained attributes such as distinct User, Application, and Relationship Type Identity to construct access controls (rules) that inform data access privileges.

### Technology Leadership via Pragmatic Innovation

Even in recent times, the urge to accelerate digital transformation through exploitation of artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, and machine learning remains challenged by the perennial hurdles presented by disparate data virtualization and data access security,” said Kingsley Idehen, Founder & CEO of OpenLink Software.

Consistent with our technological leadership and pedigree of innovation, Virtuoso 8.0 transforms these challenges into massive opportunities for agility enhancement, aimed at individuals and enterprises alike, without introducing undue complexity, expense, or privacy compromises, and without disrupting existing data access, management, or integration infrastructure,” he added.

### Benefits Summary

- **_Cognitive Agility_** uses declarative reasoning and inference to aid in creation and adoption of new Systems-Of-Intelligence ([SOI](http://linkeddata.uriburner.com/describe/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkingsley.idehen.net%2FDAV%2Fhome%2Fkidehen%2FPublic%2FLinked%2520Data%2520Documents%2FNanotations%2Frandom-bigdata-semantic-web-notes.ttl%23SystemOfIntelligence&distinct=1)) that are loosely-coupled to existing Systems-Of-Record ([SOR](http://linkeddata.uriburner.com/describe/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkingsley.idehen.net%2FDAV%2Fhome%2Fkidehen%2FPublic%2FLinked%2520Data%2520Documents%2FNanotations%2Frandom-bigdata-semantic-web-notes.ttl%23SystemOfRecord&distinct=1)) and Systems-Of-Engagement ([SOE](http://linkeddata.uriburner.com/describe/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkingsley.idehen.net%2FDAV%2Fhome%2Fkidehen%2FPublic%2FLinked%2520Data%2520Documents%2FNanotations%2Frandom-bigdata-semantic-web-notes.ttl%23SystemOfEngagement&distinct=1)).  
    
- **_Intelligent Security_** applies relationship type semantics to contemporary challenges such as verifiable identity and data provenance that scales to use across the Web and Internet.  
    
- **_Cost Effective_** coherently incorporates innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Multi-Model Data Management, without ripping and replacing” their investments in existing legacy systems.  
    

### Feature Highlights in Virtuoso 8.0

- **_Custom Reasoning and Inference Rules_** build upon open standards such as SPARQL and the SPIN Vocabulary  
    
- **_Enhanced Relation Mapping_** uses terms from the W3C's R2RML Vocabulary to map SQL Relation Tables to RDF Statement Graph(s)  
    
- **_Enhanced Security_** with ABAC (Attribute-based Access Controls) and the WebID+TLS+Delegation Protocol, existing open standards (such as TLS, HTTPS, URIs, and RDF) are leveraged to aid the development and deployment of new and more-agile services and solutions  
    

### Benefits Summary

- “Deceptively Simple” Knowledge Graph construction from existing Data Sources — enterprise knowledge manifests as live entity relationship graphs (data networks) constructed from hyperlinks
- Sophisticated Security for addressing vulnerability challenges posed by Knowledge Graphs — uses and exploits reasoning and inference to secure data that spans all data access entry points, i.e., HTTP, ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET, OLE DB, XMLA, etc.
- Fully exploit all of Virtuoso’s features without disrupting any ongoing activities or services
- Cost-effective pricing — based on Concurrent Database Access and Logical Processor usage
- Flexible Deployment options — including on-premise, cloud, hybrid clouds

#### Feature Highlights in Virtuoso 8.3

- Enhanced external data integration services enable construction of Knowledge Graphs from CSV documents by way of change-sensitive attachments and/or bulk imports
- Fusion of SQL and SPARQL Query Languages brings the best of both open standards to bear on Knowledge Graph definition and manipulation
- Broadened collection of end-user tools that immediately increase productivity with out-of-the-box functionality
- Creation of Dynamic Smart Folders (a/k/a DETs) for integration of data from documents hosted by Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Amazon S3, Box, WebDAV, LDP, IMAP4 mailboxes, and more
- Powerful content crawler for transformation and integration of content from HTTP-based networks
