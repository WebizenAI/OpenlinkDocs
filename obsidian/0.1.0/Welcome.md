This is a guide for Openlink Virtuoso 8.X

Virtuoso Universal Server is [described in WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuoso_Universal_Server)  as ' [middleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware "Middleware") and [database engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_engine "Database engine") hybrid that combines the functionality of a traditional [relational database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system "Relational database management system") (RDBMS), [object–relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_database "Object–relational database") (ORDBMS), [virtual database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_database_system "Federated database system"), [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework "Resource Description Framework"), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML"), [free-text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-text "Free-text"), [web application server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_server "Application server") and [file server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_server "File server") functionality in a single system.' 

The Virtuoso project was born in 1998 from a merger of the **OpenLink** data access [middleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware "Middleware") and **Kubl** RDBMS, which was a [relational database systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system "Relational database management system") with roots in [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland "Finland"), alongside [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL "MySQL"), [InnoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InnoDB "InnoDB"), and [Solid RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolidDB "SolidDB")/[Solid Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solid_Technologies&action=edit&redlink=1 "Solid Technologies (page does not exist)")..

Key personnel behind OpenLink Virtuoso, InnoDB, and [Solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solid_Technologies&action=edit&redlink=1 "Solid Technologies (page does not exist)") share periods of professional overlap that provide noteworthy insight into the history of database technology development in Finland. [Heikki Tuuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heikki_Tuuri&action=edit&redlink=1 "Heikki Tuuri (page does not exist)") (creator of InnoDB), [Ora Lassila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ora_Lassila "Ora Lassila") (W3C and Nokia Research, a technology lead and visionary in the areas RDF and [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web "Semantic Web") in general alongside [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee "Tim Berners-Lee")), and Orri Erling (Virtuoso Program Manager at OpenLink Software) all worked together in a startup company called [Entity Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Entity_Systems&action=edit&redlink=1 "Entity Systems (page does not exist)") in Finland – where they were developing [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp "Common Lisp") and [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog "Prolog") development environments for the early generation of [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer")'s circa. 1986–88.  

The role and influence of both Openlink Virtuoso and its key personnel, in the advancement of semantic web related technologies and systems now operating on internet cannot be easily understated. I'll venture a bit more into the history in another page at a later time. 

The first time i installed an Openlink Virtuoso Server was around 2012, and after many years of very difficult work, it is exciting to now be writing these docs, to help people learn how to set-up systems that are considered some of the best options for the future of computing, AI and knowledge management; employing, at the heart of it, the product of the long-term works, involving few yet many, in an effort to help others learn about how to do it. 

## Personal & Interpersonal (AI) Computing

This Guide is focused on how to set-up Openlink as a component for personal and interpersonal computing, powered by an ecosystem of standards employed in a generally particular way, to achieve an outcome where users can connect with the next generation of the world-wide-web and related systems, as has been an objective to make possible for humanity, for a very long time...  Whilst Openlink software and the Virtuoso Universal Server is not the only component  required to set-up and make operational these new computing personal & inter-personal, socially aware cloud storage, Artificial Intelligence platforms, it provides foundations that enable functionality that is otherwise very difficult to achieve.
## A New Age
Openlink Virtuoso has historically been used by STEM Experts, Enterprise, internet infrastructure and Governments in particular.  There is an [Open-Source Version](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource) however this has limitations and differences, overall, the commercial version is much easier to use.

Licensing for the [Personal Edition](https://shop.openlinksw.com/offers/order?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.openlinksw.com%2Foplweb%2Foffer%2FOffer-2024-09-virtuoso-8-app-developer-development-WKS-ANY%23this&type=buy&mode=v) is affordable and well worth it.

Because of its specialty history, the documentation has in-past been troublesome to get through.  Further, the implementations this documentation is intended to be most helpful with, is new.  So, it is hoped that by doing this documentation, the means to easily understand how to get going will be improved, and in-turn, others will share their contributions and advancements; so that we can all speed-up progress towards delivering these invaluable alternatives to the traditional systems, that have continued to be problematic.
# Geeks vs. Mates (& IT Guys/Girls)

Regardless of how much is able to achieve to improve the ability to make the transition to personal and interpersonal computing easier, it is expected to take a few years before those who are not computer tech savvy, can easily get things working and maintain support for it.

The hope is that people who do not have the skills or expertise to do this themselves, will be able to find someone who can help them figure out how to get it working and then sort out any technical issues they may have; as work continues to make systems better & easier to manage and before other options become more available, in what is expected to be a growing market.  For those who are amongst us 'geeks', it is believed that there are enormous benefits and opportunities in working to set-up, use, learn and develop apps and solutions that make use of these ecosystems.   At the time of writing (this is the first page), support available now is listed on the [[support]] page, and I've set-up [local-host](https://local-host.co/) which has an affiliated key base community, as listed on the website, to support the development of community and in-turn solutions, that can provide the much needed alternatives desired.
## Ecosystem Parts: Other
As is noted on [local-host](https://local-host.co/), Virtuoso is only one part of a broader software ecosystem that is being developed, whilst understanding that people will want to use, select or implement different parts and components, for different purposes, applications & environments.

These docs intend to provide some information about how to integrate with Virtuoso where required.  I will also try to provide some information about underlying technologies and related tools and learning resources, with the hope that It'll support your brave, yet exciting journey into the unknown.
